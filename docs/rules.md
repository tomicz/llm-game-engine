# Project rules (for AI / agent)

- **Do not run the game by an agent.** The user runs the game themselves.
- **Do not push or commit by an agent.** The user handles git push and commit themselves. Unless user tells agent to do it!
- **Commit multiple commits, no large commits** If agent is told to make commits, make multiple related commits.
- **Always ask before deleting files** The user decides if something has to be deleted, not agent.
- **When not sure read engine_log.txt** Might find some clues there if crashes.
